# Textureless
Welcome to the world of Textureless - where nothing is special, not even you. Roll around various buggy, untextured, meaningless courses as a luminescent sphere of unknown origin. Who knows? Maybe, if you reach the end of the dark abyss that is this universe, you can find the meaning of all this. (This is the alpha - new features, mechanics, and levels will be added soon!)
